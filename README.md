## What is This?:
This is a port of [Jay-Jay-OPL](https://github.com/Jay-Jay-OPL)'s tweaks to "Modern OPL"

I will try my best to keep the official OPL code up to date where possible.

## Current Issues:
1. Loads `POPSTARTER.ELF` but games don't boot so it runs whatever your `BOOT.ELF` is

## Other Tweaks:
Yes I am adding my own tweaks

### wLE(Planned):
My fork of wLE is going to be added into the binary allowing for this tool to be accessed without needing multiple files. My latest wLE release will be added during compilation

### POPSTARTER(Planned):
I will also be adding POPSTARTER rev13 into the OPL to allow for a close to plug and play experience

NOTE: Any files POPSTARTER needs are still required just not POPSTARTER.elf
